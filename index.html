						<h1>MONICA GELLER-BING</h1>
						<p>Monica (circa 1964) is the younger sister of Ross Geller (David Schwimmer). She is best friends with Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc), and Ross's college roommate and best friend, Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry). Raised on Long Island, she was obese in high school, weighing 255 pounds. Monica met Ross's friend, Chandler, when he and Ross were in college. After hearing Chandler call her fat, Monica lost weight and, in a flashback episode, tried to get revenge by seducing him but accidentally cut off his toe.</p>

						<h1>CHANDLER BING</h1>
						<p>Chandler Muriel Bing is a character on the hit TV show "Friends". He's portrayed by Matthew Perry. Chandler originally worked with statistical analysis and data reconfiguration (none of his friends knew what he did), and once his business made him travel from New York to Tulsa, he quit and got a job at an advertising firm. He's married to Monica Geller-Bing, and in the series finale, they adopt twins, a boy named Jack Bing and a girl named Erica Bing.</p>

						<h1>ROSS GELLER</h1>
						<p>Dr. Ross Geller is Monica's brother, and always was their (Jewish) father Jack and mother Judy's favorite, as she was horribly fat and silly, he a fairly loveable nerd. The rivalry between the siblings always remains, so deep-rooted it easily tempts them to obsessive competition, although they have grown together quite tight. Ross made his hobby into his job which he excells at, becoming a professional paleontologist ('Dino-gay' in Joey, Rachel and Phoebe's simplistic terms), yet only Chandler, who was his college roommate, has any respect for his academic achievement, while once he becomes a professor his students respect isn't quite a given either, and his incurable clumsiness all but helps.</p>

						<h1>RACHEL GREEN</h1>
						<p>When the friends first met Rachel Green, she was young, naive and spoiled. That fateful day, she had just narrowly escaped from marrying Barry Farber. Rachel's explanation for why she didn't marry Barry was, "Because I was more turned on by a gravy boat." Monica ended up taking Rachel under her wing after her rich father cut her off. Rachel was forced to cut up all of her credit cards. Rachel tried to find a job but was laughed at at every single interview she attended. Clearly not fazed, Rachel found a job at Central Perk, where all the friends hung out. She would have this job for another couple of years.</p>

						<h1>JOEY TRIBBIANI</h1>
						<p>Joey Tribbiani is an Italian-American New Yorker who is the only male out of 8 children, and passionately addicted to eating. He is a dim-witted, skirt-chasing actor, mostly desperately unemployed except for two periods as Dr. Drake Ramore in the soap Days of Our Lives, who is yet likeable due to his disarmingly naive personality and an almost infallible womanizer, to his mates's envious admiration. He is for years roommate with his best friend Chandler, and later a while with Rachel, whom he falls in love with. When Chandler and Monica leave Manhattan, Joey moves to Los Angeles to continue his acting career and goes live with his bossy sister Gina and her academically brilliant teenage son Michael.</p>

						<h1>PHOEBE BUFFAY</h1>
						<p>Phoebe Buffay lived in uptown New York until when she was twelve her mother killed herself and she lived a life on the street. Previous to that her father had abandoned her, her twin sister Ursula, and her mother. Early on in the series a grandmother is shown but later dies.
						Phoebe was not really the main character in any episodes until late in the show. Early on she had a relationship with David the "science guy" who had to move to Minsk for scientific study.
